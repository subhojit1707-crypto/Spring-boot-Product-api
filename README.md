# Task 1 Verification (CRUD API)

## Get All Products

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/products
```

## Get Product By ID

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/products/1
```

## Create Product

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/products \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"name":"Laptop","description":"Gaming Laptop","price":20000}'
```

```

## Delete Product

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/api/products/1
```
